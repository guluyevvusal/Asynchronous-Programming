# Async Programming #

Async allows programs to perform long-running operations (e.g., network requests, file reads/writes) without blocking other work.

Methods with async/await perform "lazy execution". Tasks are used to handle non-blocking operations.

Parallel.ForEach allows you to process elements in an array in parallel.
